# Caculating Expected Loss
$\text{EL} = \text{PD} \times \text{LGD} \times \text{EAD}$ 
Where
- EL: Expected Loss
- PD: Probability of default
    - Lik
- LGD: Loss given default
    - The proportion of the total exposure that cannot be recovered by the lender once a default has occurred
- EAD: Exposure at default
    - The total value that a lender is exposed to when a borrower defaults
    - Maximum value the lender would loss when a default happens

## Example
Given that:
- borrow wanna buy a $500,000 dollar house
- lender would fund 80% of the purchase a.k.a. Loan to value (LTV)
- Loan amount would be 400k, assume borrow already pained 40k, then remaining left to be paid would be 360k (which is th EAD)
- Assume that there is empirical evidence that one in four homeowners have defaulted, the PD = 25%
- Assume if the borrower defaults and the bank can sell the house at $342k, the LGD = $18k / $360k = 5%
- EL for this very moment = 0.25 x 0.05 x $360k = $4.5k
