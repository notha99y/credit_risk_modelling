# Regulation
## Regulators rules
1. Regulate bank operations and hence reduce risky behavior
1. Guarentee to the public that the banking system is in good health
    - Capital Adequacy or Regulatory Capital: Banks are required to have enough capital to absorb the loss given a default for their loans

## Capital Requirement
- The capital which a bank needs to have in their balance sheet is determined as a proportion of its assets which is mainly loans.
- The capital requirements need to take in account the risk associated with each loan/portfolio
- This is done by weighting the assets with it risk => Risk weighted assets (RWA)
- Capital requirment postulates that the bank needs to hold the capital that is equal or more than the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)
- $\text{CAR} = \frac{\text{Capital}}{\text{Risk-weighted assets}} \ge 8\%$



## Basel II Accord
- How much capital banks need to have
- How capital is defined
- How capital is compared against risk-weighted assets

The primary objective of the Basel II Accord is to ensure that the amount of capital allocation bank carries out are risk sensitive. i.e. The greater the risk a bank is exposed to, the greater the amount of capital it needs to hold to safeguard it solvency and overall economic stability

## Types of Risks
1. Credit Risk (Focus)
1. Operation Risk
1. Market Risk

## Credit Risk
There are two main ways to calculation of Credit Risks are regulated
1. Standardized Approach (SA)
1. Internal Ratings Based (IRB) Approaches
    1. Foundation Internal Ratings Based (F-IRB)
    1. Advanced Internal Ratings Based (A-IRB)
## SA vs IRB
|  | SA | F-IRB | A-IRB|
|-- |-- |-- |-- |
|PD |Externally provided | Internally Estimated |Interanlly Estimated |
|LGD |Externally provided | Externally provided |Interanlly Estimated |
|EAG |Externally provided | Externally provided |Interanlly Estimated |

## External Credit Ratings
External agencies that provide credit ratings:
- FICO (Individual)
- S&P Global
- Moody's
- FitchRating

### FICO Score
- For individual borrowers
- range from 300 to 850 where the higher the FICO score the more credit worthy the person
- Risk weight for retail exposure is 75%
    - Credit card or consumer loans
- Risk weight for loans secured by residential properties is 35%
    - Mortgages
### S&P Global Credit Rating Scale
- Ratings For firms, countries, financial insitutions are show as letters

| | Prime | High Grade | Upper Medium Grade | Lower Medium Grade | Non-Investment Grade Speculative | Highly Speculative | etc.. |
|-- |-- |-- |-- |-- |-- |-- |-- |
|Credit Rating |AAA |AA+ AA AA- |A+ A A- |BBB+ BBB BBB- |BB+ BB BB- |B+ B B- |.. |
|Risk Weights for Countries |0% |0% |20% |50% |100% |150% |.. |
|Risk Weights for Furms |20% |20% |50% |100% |150% |150% |.. |


## Why IRB Approach?
- Allow banks to establish their own credit ratings
- Precise calulations about the held capital for each individual exposure
- Allocate resources to cover loss => Be more profitable

| | SA | IRB |
|-- |-- |-- |
|RWA | 75% | <75% |
|Retail Loans | 8% of 75% of Capital | > 8% of 75% of Capital |
